There are two adjacent tracts of timber in a small watershed
called the upper Umpqua. Both land tracts are owned by
Columbia Mill, a small forest products company. Each of
these two tracts contain mature timber stands, which can be
harvested. Columbia Mill plans to cut portions of these two
stands to supply their mill for the next month. Then, they will
move their cutting operations to other forest tracts that they
own in a different watershed. The two tracts differ somewhat
in their slope and size of timber. Columbia Mill plans to cut
selected trees from each track, an approach called thinning.

Thinning all of tract 1 will yield 225,000 board feet
of lumber and thinning all of tract 2 will yield
200,000 board feet of lumber. Columbia Mill needs
a total of 250,000 board feet from these two tracts
for their mill operations. It costs $600 per 1,000
board feet to harvest from tract 1 and $400 per
1,000 board feet harvested from tract 2. Harvesting
from these two forest tracts will result in some
erosion, which will end up as sediment in the
Umpqua creek, even while maintaining no-harvest
buffer zones along the creek.

They are prevented by the state environmental
protection agency from producing more than 4,500
lbs. of sediment from their activities. The amount of
sediment produced per 1,000 board feet harvested
from tract 1 is 10 lbs. The amount of sediment
generated per 1,000 board feet harvested in tract 2
is 30 lbs. Columbia Mill needs to determine how
much timber should be harvested from each tract?
The objective is to find the least-cost timber supply
plan for Columbia Mill.

To solve this problem we need to identify how
much timber should be harvested from each
tract. Since these are the decisions to be made,
we will represent these decisions with variables:
